The risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, as well as acute and chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma, can all be reduced by breathing clean air. Long-term and short-term cardiovascular and respiratory health are both improved by lower air pollution levels.

Humans, animals, and even plants are harmed by the chemicals and particles that make up air pollution. 
Other contemporary environmental issues caused by poor air quality include global warming, acid rain, reduced visibility, smog, climate change, and premature deaths.
